## 0.9.0 (Dec 29, 2025)

#### Initial Release

This library, heavily inspired by a few existing AMQP 0-9-1 clients (the original Bunny, Pika, amqprs, the .NET RabbitMQ client 7.x)
is now mature enough to be publicly released.

It targets Swift 6.x and uses modern Swift's concurrency features.

In addition, this is the 2nd AMQP 0-9-1 client — after .NET client 7.x — to support
automatic publisher confirm tracking and acknowledgement.
